										<p>Building design refers to the broadly based architectural, engineering and technical applications to the design of buildings. All building projects require the services of a building designer, typically a licensed architect or structural engineer.</p>
										<p>Smaller, less complicated projects often do not require a licensed professional, and the design of such projects is often undertaken by building designers, draftspersons, interior designers (for interior fit-outs or renovations), or contractors. Larger, more complex building projects require the services of many professionals trained in specialist disciplines, usually coordinated by an architect.</p>
										<p>Since 1978 Designer Services has brought meticulous craftsmanship and innovative solutions to design and engineering communities. Our attention to detail and unwavering commitment to "on time, on budget" deliveries affords us long-term relationships with our customers, whether first time inventors or Fortune 100 companies. With the passing of the torch to a third generation in leadership approaching, we are excited to progress and evolve to further meet the needs of communities where we serve.</p>

Three buildings to the west of St. George's Catholic Church separate it from an intersection of Town Highway 25 and Vermont Route 108. Across the road from St. George's Church lies a cemetery, and to the west of the cemetery is a village green, separating it from Route 108. To the east of the building is roughly four acres of open land, owned by the town. To the southwest of the building is a small, wooded area.</p>

									        	<p class="blog">The 3 x 5 bay rectangular, gable-front, common bond brick building is two and a half stories tall, was built in 1840 as a Greek Revival structure, and was remodeled c.1905 with Gothic Revival features. The building has a stone foundation and is covered with a standing seam metal roof, which has a wooden cornice return and a wooden belfry. A one and a half story addition (c.1905) that extends from the rear facade has a hipped roof with a central hexagonal dormer facing south. The brick veneer and fieldstone foundation of the entire building has been painted red.</p>

											<p class="blog">Fenestration consists of tall, narrow pointed-arch, colored stained-glass windows in the Gothic Revival style. These windows extend through the two stories on the eave sides. Uneven bricks give evidence of masonry repair that must have occurred during the change from two stories of 12/12 Greek Revival windows to a single row of tall, narrow Gothic-style windows that span two stories. On the gable-front is a quatrefoil stained-glass window in the window peak, and there are three pointed-arch, stained-glass windows, similar to, but shorter than those on the eave sides, in the second story. There are no windows in the first story of the north facade.</p>
